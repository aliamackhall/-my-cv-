# Alia Hall
## Texts and Technology Doctoral Scholar

### About Me
My reasearch interests stem from autoethnographical experiences as a woman of color in predominantly white institutions or PWIs. I aim to explore DEI initatives in higher education and add to the existing knowledge about the experiences of non-white scholars to encourage growth and equity. 

## Academic Biographical Journey
- Bachelor of Arts in Communication Studies and Organizational Leadership
- Master of Arts in Business Communication
- Doctoral Student in Texts and Technology focusing on Scientific and Tech Communication
